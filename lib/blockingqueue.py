class TwoLevelQueue(object):
    """
    A blocking queue with uniqueness and two priorities.

    The basic idea is to use as scheduling queue for cronned jobs (low priority)
    and spontaneously-triggered jobs (high priority). A job still scheduled
    will not be scheduled twice if, say, his cron timer expires while the last
    one didn't get serviced yet, though a trigger will move a job from the low-
    to the high-priority queue if neccessary.

    Methods defined here:

    pushLow(elem)  push onto low queue, or no-op if already in a queue
    pushHigh(elem) push onto high queue, potentially removing from low first
    pop()          grab an element from the high queue, or low queue if empty,
                   or block until one of the queues is nonempty
    shutdown()     makes any call to pop() raise SystemExit, and unblocks any
                   threads blocking on pop()
