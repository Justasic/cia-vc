""" LibCIA.Security

Implements CIA's simple security model. CIA uses a simple
capabilities-like system, where a particular capability is represented
on the wire as an unguessable random key, and internally by nearly any
python object.

Generally the 'universe' key will be saved somewhere only the server's
owner can access it on startup. The 'universe' key can be used to grant
other keys, which can then be distributed to other people or machines.

Note that this system has many of the same qualities as traditional
capabilities, but is not implemented in the same way. In traditional
capabilities, the unguessable keys map directly to objects that provide
whatever interface that key grants permissions to. This is simple and
effective for some systems, however in CIA the meaning of a key must be
preserved over a long period of time regardless of code changes- simply
making keys map to pickled callable objects would be too fragile.
