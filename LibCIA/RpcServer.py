       This is based on Twisted's XMLRPC server class, but overrides most
       of its functions :)

       Improvements in this, as compared to twisted's default XMLRPC class:

         - This makes the request object available to functions if they
           want it, making it possible for them to read HTTP headers.

         - This implements multiple function prefixes, each defining a
           different interface that function operates under.

         - A 'protected' function prefix requires a valid capability key
           to use the function, helping to enforce our security policies.

         - Less buggy (compared to Twisted 1.1.1) handling of
           nested subhandlers
