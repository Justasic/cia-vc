""" LibCIA.Web.RegexTransform

Applies formatting to text in Nouvelle trees using regular expressions.
Each formatting class includes a dictionary of regular expressions mapped
to handler functions. When a regular expression is encountered, the handler
is called with the match object and the returned Nouvelle tree is inserted
in the original text's place.

This system can be used to auto-hyperlink URLs, format source code, and
probably much more.
