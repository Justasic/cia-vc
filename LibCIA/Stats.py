""" LibCIA.Stats

Defines the stats:// URI for rulesets to target. The URI is of
the form stats://[optional/path/prefix]
The message passed to the URI from a ruleset is then URI encoded
and used as the rest of the stats:// path. This makes it easy to
create multiple namespaces for which stats are collected, and generate
the actual stats target using part of the message.
