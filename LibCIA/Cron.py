""" LibCIA.Cron

A simple scheduler for repeated events. Each event is represented
by a frequency in seconds, and a callable that handles the event.

Trigger times are always an integer multiple of the period, so
any period that one day can be evenly divided into will always run
at the same time each day. An event with a period of an hour will
always run at the top of the hour, and an event that runs
every 15 minutes will always run at :00, :15, :30, and :45.

Events are guaranteed not to be triggered too early, but they might
be late if the system is heavily loaded.

Normally all triggers are run once when they are added, since
presumably if the server is just starting it will have missed a lot
of opportunities to trigger events. This makes sense for most
maintenance tasks. If it doesn't, you can disable that by adding the
event with runNow=False.
