""" LibCIA

This is a Python package providing modules used to implement the CIA
open source notification system.

CIA provides a way for projects to send messages from their version
control and bug tracking systems to anyone interested- mainly a
network of IRC bots and a web site.

Where does the name CIA come from? It was originally designed to
monitor commits from PicoGUI's Subversion repository, and Lalo came
up with the name CIA: it was a brainless entity designed to keep
an eye on Subversion ;)
