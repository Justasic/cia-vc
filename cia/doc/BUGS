Known Bugs
==========

- Large messages get truncated somewhere between the client script and the database,
  causing messages with invalid XML to be present.

- These invalid messages cause XML parsing errors when formatting the RSS feeds.
  The normal stats summary page explicitly ignores badly formed messages.

- Many of the module imports are messy. Relative imports should be removed according
  to section 2.4 of the python programming FAQ, and the order could use some cleanup.

- Much of the site is outdated and many libraries (such as Nouvelle) are deprecated or
  desperately out of date
