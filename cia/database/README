This directory contains SQL files for initializing and upgrading
CIA's database. Init scripts include one database format revision,
and describe/create the database for that revision. Upgrade scripts
specify two revisions, and convert an existing database of the
first revision to a database of the second revision.

The current code always expects the database to be in the highest
revision listed here, so if you're creating a new database, use
the highest numbered init script!
