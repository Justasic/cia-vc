#
# Upgrades a CIA database from version 6 to version 7.
#
# Version 7 of the database marked the removal of the
# stats_messages table, moving all messages into a custom
# ring buffer format. This script will read in stats_messages
# and generate the new flat files according to the default
# paths in the LibCIA.Files module.
#
# Back up your database before running this!
#
# Note that this process isn't fully automatic. If the
# conversion is successful, you'll want to manually bump
# the database version to 7, and remove the stats_messages
# table. Since InnoDB won't reclaim the space, you may
# wish to dump the whole database, delete the innodb table
# space, then reload the database. This isn't nearly as
# bad as it sounds, since the db is quite reasonably
# sized without stats_messages.
#
# If the conversion takes a while and you want to pick
# up the commits you missed while the conversion was taking
# place, note the ID of the last converted message and add
# a "WHERE id > foo" clause to the stats_messages query.
