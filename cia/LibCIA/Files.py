""" LibCIA.Files

This module is just a centralized place to manage CIA's filesystem
usage. A top-level data directory can be set here during initialization,
and this module is later queried for individual directories to use.

The top-level directory ('data' by default) is split into three branches:

  db     Persistent data that should be backed up.

  temp   Transient files. These should be automatically deleted when they
         are no longer needed. It's safe to clear this directory when the
         server isn't running.

  cache  Data that is cached to improve performance, but can be rebuilt
         from 'db' at any time. Files in the cache can be safely removed
         at any time.

  log    Log files written by the server. These are only for the
         administrator's benefit, and can be removed at any time.
