- The XML-RPC interface needs a way to protect some commands, probably by requiring
  a random 'magic cookie' as an argument. This should include at least 'rebuild', and
  possibly the commands for changing rulesets. This MUST be done before port 3910
  on navi is opened to the public.

- Getting told to join a nonexistent server probably breaks BotNetwork. This hasn't
  been tested yet, but as far as I can tell it will enter an infinite loop getting
  connection failures and reassigning channels to other bots.

- The IRC ruleset load/save code is a bit messy, it should be generalized and
  moved to the XML module

- The gtk ruleset_editor needs refactoring, it's getting messy
