- The Stats code can store message counts now, but still needs a way to query
  data, store the last n messages, and maybe even keep RRDs up to date.

- The XML-RPC interface needs a way to protect some commands, probably by requiring
  a random 'magic cookie' as an argument. This should include at least 'rebuild', and
  possibly the commands for changing rulesets. This MUST be done before port 3910
  on navi is opened to the public.

- Formatters need to be able to take parameters, so they can be generalized more.
  For example, IRCProjectName should be refactored into a generic prefixing
  formatter that could instead prepend a module name, for channels that only
  display one project

- The message format supports much more metadata, but everything is still going
  through the legacy commit format first. Need to add a command to the incoming
  mail parser to send XML messages, write clients that use the new format,
  and write formatters that convert the new messages to IRC text

- Message filters (for scraping mailing lists) are in dire need of refactoring,
  and should be made to use the XML-RPC interface instead of sending email
