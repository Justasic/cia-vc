- We need a stats browser

- Rulesets could use some sort of subroutine call, maybe by embedding a <ruleset>
  tag with a different ruleset's URI. A new URI scheme could be added for rulesets
  that will never be executed on their own but should be referenceable from inside
  others.

- The Security module currently assumes that a particular python object will
  always pickle to the same value, which is flawed.

- Formatters need to be able to take parameters, so they can be generalized more.
  For example, IRCProjectName should be refactored into a generic prefixing
  formatter that could instead prepend a module name, for channels that only
  display one project

- The message format supports much more metadata, but everything is still going
  through the legacy commit format first. Need to add a command to the incoming
  mail parser to send XML messages, write clients that use the new format,
  and write formatters that convert the new messages to IRC text

- Message filters (for scraping mailing lists) are in dire need of refactoring,
  and should be made to use the XML-RPC interface instead of sending email
