- The XML-RPC interface needs a way to protect some commands, probably by requiring
  a random 'magic cookie' as an argument. This should include at least 'rebuild', and
  possibly the commands for changing rulesets. This MUST be done before port 3910
  on navi is opened to the public.

- The IRC ruleset load/save code is a bit messy, it should be generalized and
  moved to the XML module

- The gtk ruleset_editor needs refactoring, it's getting messy

- Formatters need to be able to take parameters, so they can be generalized more.
  For example, IRCProjectName should be refactored into a generic prefixing
  formatter that could instead prepend a module name, for channels that only
  display one project

- The message format supports much more metadata, but everything is still going
  through the legacy commit format first. Need to add a command to the incoming
  mail parser to send XML messages, write clients that use the new format,
  and write formatters that convert the new messages to IRC text

- Stats are still going through the old code. Need to add another client to the
  Message.Hub that will store stats in some kind of database that's accessable
  to a web frontend.

- Message filters (for scraping mailing lists) are in dire need of refactoring,
  and should be made to use the XML-RPC interface instead of sending email

- When twistd.log rolls over to twistd.log.1, something in twisted is folding
  it, which makes all the XML snippets with long lines look really horribly
  disgusting. This needs to be disabled.
