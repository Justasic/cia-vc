######## Critical

- The IRC bot allocator really needs rethinking (again). It's looking like a much
  better approach would be to have a Request object that specifies a channel and
  server that should be serviced by a bot. The request object would then have the
  logic to know if it's been satisfied, and if not, try to find and/or create a
  bot to satisfy it. The request object would also manage timeouts such that if
  a bot takes too long to join or connect to a channel, that request will still
  be unsatisfied.

  Whenever a request is modified plus every so often on a timer, requests would
  be reevaluated- unstatisfied requests that have reached their timeout will get
  another chance to start bots and such, bots or channels that aren't fulfilling
  any requests will get removed, bots will try to take their preferred nick if
  they don't have it already.

######## Noncritical

- The XML parser (somewhat hacked up domish) breaks when messages specify
  a namespace.

######## Cleanups

- FIXME for hardcoding URLs in the ruleset browser

- Message filters (for scraping mailing lists) are in dire need of refactoring,
  and should be made to use the XML-RPC interface instead of sending email

######## Enhancements

- Web interface for editing rulesets and stats metadata- how would we handle
  authentication, if necessary?

- Rulesets could use some sort of subroutine call, maybe by embedding a <ruleset>
  tag with a different ruleset's URI. A new URI scheme could be added for rulesets
  that will never be executed on their own but should be referenceable from inside
  others.

- Formatters need to be able to take parameters, so they can be generalized more.
  For example, IRCProjectName should be refactored into a generic prefixing
  formatter that could instead prepend a module name, for channels that only
  display one project

- Client scripts should be updated for the XML message format, and the formatters
  enhanced where necessary.

- Look into moving from Rack to SQL (e.g. sqlite) for the stats database

- Support for deleting stats targets

- documentation
