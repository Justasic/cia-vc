# Pound 2.2 configuration file for CIA.
#
# Pound is an HTTP proxy and load-balancer that
# forms the front-end for CIA on the web. RPC
# requests are sent to the monolithic message
# dispatch and administration server.
#
# All other requests (read-only requests, and
# requests which write to the database) can
# be load-balanced across several instances
# of the web server.
