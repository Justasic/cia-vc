We Need Hosting

you too can donate bandwidth, CPU, and RAM to open source
=========================================================

The Problem
-----------

Right now CIA is running on navi.cx, an Athlon XP machine situated in the
living room of CIA's author's apartment, furnished with two relatively
small DSL lines. It can handle CIA's bandwidth needs for now, but CIA is
a growing bot and we fear navi won't be an adequate home for long.

Needs
-----

For us to consider a new host for CIA, it must meet the following requirements:

- It needs an operating system capable of running CIA.

    In theory this is
    anything that Python can run on, but it would be the least hassle if it
    is a Linux machine.

- We need a normal user account on the hosting machine, accessable via ssh.

    Everything except possibly HTTP proxy configuration should be doable
    without any special account, though it would be handy if the administrator
    could install packages that CIA depends on.

- It would need to be able to serve HTTP traffic for http://cia.navi.cx.

    The web server is in the same process as the rest of CIA, but like in the
    current setup it could be proxied from another server. Currently HTTP
    traffic to CIA first passes into an Apache named virtual host, then via
    a ProxyPass directive into CIA's VHostMonster.

- CIA needs a MySQL database, with a good amount of potential disk space.

    Our `current needs` aren't too high, but keep in mind the new stats system
    has only been in place for weeks. Preferably a couple gigabytes of space
    would be available for CIA if it needed it.

- CIA must be able to make and sustain outgoing connections.

    This is of course needed for IRC bots, but CIA also can send XML-RPC
    notifications, and in the future it might support Jabber or other IM
    protocols.

- CIA needs to accept incoming email.

    Preferably this would involve giving
    the new host an MX record for cia.navi.cx, encouraging people to switch
    their client scripts to a compatible address, then redirecting all other
    addresses from navi to the new host. All email is filtered via procmail,
    and piped into one of several small python scripts.

- No obtrusive advertising.

    We would be happy to display a small image thanking the host and linking
    to them, in the page's footer, but nothing obtrusive. Definitely no form
    of ad banners would be allowed.

- CIA needs a relatively speedy machine.

    It needs a decent amount of RAM and CPU. In the current setup it uses
    around 20MB of RAM and depending on the page serves maybe 10 requests
    per second on a 1GHz Athlon XP. Of course optimization and caching is
    expected to reduce this load dramatically, but the host should still be
    decently speedy.

- CIA probably doesn't need that much bandwidth, but it might...

    It should have a good amount of bandwidth at its disposal, but CIA
    probably won't need much yet. Actual figures on CIA's bandwidth usage
    are pending, but keep in mind that right now it's on two DSL lines.

- It needs to be free or very cheap.

    CIA's author is a college student with little cash.
