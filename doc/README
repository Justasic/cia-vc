CIA Open Source Notification System, version 0.84-pre
=====================================================

About CIA
---------

CIA is at its heart a system for distributing commit messages from the
version control systems used by open source projects worldwide. It started
out as a simple IRC bot distributing commit messages from the PicoGUI project,
but has grown into a general message passing, filtering, and formatting system
with web, IRC, XML-RPC, and email interfaces.


Top-level components of CIA
---------------------------

- cia_server.tac

    CIA's services for processing XML-RPC and web browser requests as well as
    its outgoing connections for IRC are all run from within one Twisted
    twistd process. This is the configuration file that plugs together the
    above module into an actual application.
    The CIA server is usually started by running "twistd -oy cia_server.tac"

- database

    Scripts for maintaining CIA's SQL database. You must run init.sql to
    set up the tables CIA requires.

- mail

    Filter incoming email with procmail and dispatch it to the CIA server

- tools

    Administration and debugging tools that access CIA over XML-RPC

- htdocs

    Contains the static files served by CIA's web interface, in a namespace
    merged with the one created dynamically in cia_server.tac. This directory
    contains the client scripts referenced in the documentation, since they
    are served over the web.

- doc

    Documentation for CIA, in reStructuredText format. This is both easy to
    read as it is, and easy for CIA's web interface to present in XHTML.


An overview of CIA's internals
------------------------------

- LibCIA.Message

    Defines a generic format for passing messages around in XML, a python
    encapsulation for that format, a Hub to distribute these messages, and
    a Filter system based on XPath for selecting interesting messages

- LibCIA.Formatters

    Formatters provide a way to automatically convert messages to
    human-readable representations in different output media

- LibCIA.Ruleset

    A ruleset associates a URI with a set of message filters and formatters,
    combining both into an intuitive but powerful XML format

- LibCIA.IncomingMail

    Converts email messages to XML Messages, with support for the old CIA's
    format for backward compatibility.

- LibCIA.IRC

    A URI handler used in conjunction with Rulesets to deliver messages to IRC
    channels. Defines a BotNetwork object that manages any number of bots on
    any number of IRC networks.

- LibCIA.Stats

    Handles the stats:// URI used to collect information on messages. These stats
    can then be queried over the web or over XML-RPC.

- LibCIA.Web

    A web interface to CIA built with Nouvelle
