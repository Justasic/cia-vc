===================================
CIA Open Source Notification System
===================================

A real-time window into the open source world
=============================================


Introduction
------------

CIA is a system for tracking open-source projects in real-time.
People all over the world are constantly collaborating and creating
software, creating a constant flow of new code and new ideas. CIA
provides an easy way for people to observe this flow. Developers can
see the latest changes to their code immediately, users can subscribe
to see the latest bugfixes in their favorite programs. Everyone can
take a chance to step back and look at open source development as
a whole.

The end result of CIA can be viewed in several ways:

- The online `stats browser`_
- RSS feeds, linked to from each stats page
- The #commits channel on the Freenode_ IRC network
- Your favorite project's IRC channel, if they have requested that a CIA bot_ join it

How does CIA work?

Every project that is 'connected' to CIA has some way of representing
its commit messages, bug tracker updates, or other messages in XML.
The CIA project defines a format that these messages must adhere to.
The messages are then delivered to CIA using XML-RPC or e-mail.

The best method of creating and delivering messages for CIA, and the
method most projects use, is to install a `client script`_ in the
project's version control system. This isn't the only way of course.
Several projects are connected to CIA using scripts that read
mailing lists and convert the messages therein to CIA's format. Projects
that have been connected to CIA for a while and haven't upgraded their
clients might also be using an older non-XML format that has been
retrospectively named colorText.

Once these messages arrive at the CIA server's message hub, they are
then filtered and formatted using rulesets_ and dispatched via URIs.
Currently CIA has URI handlers for the online stats system, IRC bots,
and XML-RPC delivery.

CIA is implemented using the Python_ programming language and Twisted_
networking framework. It is Free Software, licensed under the `GNU GPL`_.
The source is available from a Subversion_ repository_.

History
-------

- May 23, 2003

    CIA started out as a simple bot hacked together by Micah Dowty in an
    afternoon to monitor commit messages for the PicoGUI_ project.  Lalo
    Martins came up with the name "CIA" to refer to this IRC bot:
    PicoGUI_ is hosted in Subversion_, and the bot was a brainless entity
    designed to keep an eye on subversion :)

- June 1, 2003

    About a week later, Mike Hearn suggested expanding it to work with
    other projects, displaying them all in one channel in addition to
    the project's home channel. After a morning of quick hacking,
    #commits on Freenode_ was born. Popularity grew almost instantly.

    Micah stepped into the shadows for a while. Mike maintained CIA, but
    the code remained stagnant.  It was a quick hack, so incremental
    changes just made it messier. It needed a rewrite.

- December 13, 2003

    Micah finally gets the motivation to rewrite CIA, bringing you what
    you see here. Development has been ongoing, improving CIA's
    usefulness and reliability.

- January 20, 2004

    CIA moves from Navi, a server in Micah's living room on two DSL lines,
    to a much nicer server provided by the PLD Linux project and
    Sergiusz Pawlowicz.

CIA is written and maintained by `Micah Dowty`_.

CIA is hosted by the `PLD Linux`_ project.

CIA makes extensive use of many fine open source projects, including
Python_, Twisted_, Procmail_, MySQL_, Subversion_, Graphviz_, Sodipodi_,
Docutils_, PyGTK_, Squid_, and Linux_.

CIA uses open standards, including XHTML, CSS2, and XML-RPC.
