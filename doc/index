What is CIA?

A real-time window into the open source world
=============================================

Instant Notification
--------------------

Do you collaborate with other developers over Internet Relay Chat?
How often do you find yourself wondering what the other developers
are doing *right now*? How many people in your project need to
know immediately when new code is available to test or critique?

CIA can send an **IRC bot** to your channel to instantly report the
progress made by you and your peers::

      <CIA-5>  jupiter * r9203 xchat-gnome/buildsystem.diff:
               update for new plugins
      <staz_>  what are the new plugins?
 <purple_cow>  nothing functional yet
 <purple_cow>  working on 308765 and 320477
      <staz_>  ok
      <staz_>  thanks

Broadcast your Progress
-----------------------

CIA stores the changes it receives, and creates a **web page** for
each of your projects and each software author. These web pages
have some statistics, and they show recent progress.

Each web page is accompanied by an **RSS feed**. With these, your
users can track development as it happens. You can even syndicate
these feeds on your project's web site or your own personal site.

Join the Community
------------------

Because CIA tracks **thousands of projects**, you aren't just setting
up a notification bot: you're joining an established community.

  - Any other user can syndicate projects or groups of projects on their own IRC channel.

      Do you run a distro, or maintain a
      library? Use CIA to keep an eye on the projects you depend
      on and the projects who depend on you.

  - Your commits show up in a central IRC channel, **#commits** on Freenode_.

      Users and developers gather there out of curiosity,
      to find something new, or just to watch in amazement as
      the open source process works.

  - Show up on CIA's Front Page.

      New projects get a free fifteen
      minutes of fame, but you'll have to work to maintain a top
      activity ranking.

  - What's related?

      CIA shows you the common threads between projects.
      You like someone's code? Find out what other projects they work
      on. Just heard about a new distributed revision control system?
      See what people are using it for in the real world.

Easier than Ever
----------------

To add your project, you'll need either:

  - Any public Subversion repository

      (For instant notification, you also need a way to send
      a *ping* e-mail to CIA any time a change is committed.
      You can use an existing commits mailing list, or a very
      simple post-commit hook.)

  - A hosting provider like `SourceForge.net`_ or `Gna!`_ which
    includes built-in CIA support

  - A `CIA client script`_ for your project's revision control system

You'll also need a CIA account. `Register an account`_ if you
don't already have one, then `add your project`_.
