Tracking open source projects in real-time
==========================================


Introduction
------------

CIA is a system for tracking open-source projects in real-time.  The
most popular incarnation of CIA now is a system of IRC bots that hang
out mostly in #commits on Freenode_ and report commit messages from
over 100 open source projects, even `CIA itself`_.

CIA has just been through a complete rewrite that makes its internals
much cleaner, and lets it track more than just commit messages with
more than just IRC bots. The public interface for stats and setup
however isn't done yet. If you have a project you would like CIA to
monitor, talk to 'scanline' in #commits on freenode.

CIA is Free Software, licensed under the GPL. The source is available
from a Subversion_ repository_.


History
-------

- May 23, 2003

    CIA started out as a simple bot hacked together by Micah Dowty in an
    afternoon to monitor commit messages for the PicoGUI_ project.  Lalo
    Martins came up with the name "CIA" to refer to this IRC bot:
    PicoGUI_ is hosted in Subversion_, and the bot was a brainless entity
    designed to keep an eye on subversion :)

    About a week later, Mike Hearn suggested expanding it to work with
    other projects, displaying them all in one channel in addition to
    the project's home channel. After a morning of quick hacking,
    #commits on Freenode_ was born. Popularity grew almost instantly.

    Micah stepped into the shadows for a while. Mike maintained CIA, but
    the code remained stagnant.  It was a quick hack, so incremental
    changes just made it messier. It needed a rewrite.

    Micah finally gets the motivation to rewrite CIA, bringing you what
    you see here.
