Known Bugs
==========

- IRC bots flood off relatively frequently. For Freenode at least, flood-kicking
  is decided based on the number of untransmitted bytes in an IRC client's connection
  buffer. Preventing flood kicks will probably require a simulation of the server's
  buffer, with the CIA bot automatically throttling as appropriate to keep that buffer
  under a preset limit.

  This is necessary rather than just throttling using a fixed number of lines/second
  for several reasons. The server flood-kicks based on bytes in the connection buffer,
  so it's connection-wide rather than local to one channel. Secondly, the server will
  send most lines immediately, but if a connection has been spewing for a while it
  throttles it server-side, eventually leading to a full buffer and a flood-kick.

- Leading spaces in commit messages aren't handled well. They aren't visible
  in the web interface because they aren't converted to non-breaking spaces
  where necessary, and due to strip()'ing the log in the IRC formatter,
  leading space is gone from the first line but there may be too much
  on the other lines. The stripping code should be changed to remove
  homogeneous leading spacing, and convert multiple spaces to &nbsp; in the
  XHTML formatters.

- The MIME types the web server gives out are a bit weird in the client
  scripts directory. Everything except HTML and images should probably be
  given out as text/plain.

- The XML parser (somewhat hacked up domish) breaks when messages specify
  a namespace. This should be fixed by porting from domish to 4Suite.
