important
---------

 - Rate limiting and load balancing to prevent bots from flooding off

 - Some of the stats catalogs are getting rather big and it would be good
   to make the full message list accessable and searchable. An SQL-aware table
   widget for this has been started in the cia-data-driven-tables branch.

 - Bots need to remove or disable their irc:// ruleset when kicked from a
   channel.
  
   This will become important once the web interface for IRC ruleset editing
   is written- if someone invites a CIA bot into a channel where it isn't
   wanted, the channel's ops need to be able to ask it to leave. As it is
   now, the botnet tries a little too hard and the bot will
   just immediately rejoin.

noncritical
-----------

 - The XML parser (somewhat hacked up domish) breaks when messages specify
   a namespace.

 - FIXME for hardcoding URLs in the ruleset browser
