Known Bugs
==========

- It looks like somehow most DOM Document objects are getting linked to each other,
  resulting in hundreds of ungarbagecollected messages after a week or so of uptime.
  This makes for a pretty icky memory leak.

- Many of the module imports are messy. Relative imports should be removed according
  to section 2.4 of the python programming FAQ, and the order could use some cleanup.

- IRC bots flood off relatively frequently. For Freenode at least, flood-kicking
  is decided based on the number of untransmitted bytes in an IRC client's connection
  buffer. Preventing flood kicks will probably require a simulation of the server's
  buffer, with the CIA bot automatically throttling as appropriate to keep that buffer
  under a preset limit.

  This is necessary rather than just throttling using a fixed number of lines/second
  for several reasons. The server flood-kicks based on bytes in the connection buffer,
  so it's connection-wide rather than local to one channel. Secondly, the server will
  send most lines immediately, but if a connection has been spewing for a while it
  throttles it server-side, eventually leading to a full buffer and a flood-kick.
