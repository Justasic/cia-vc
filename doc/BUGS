- Rate limiting and load balancing to prevent bots from flooding off

- Some of the stats catalogs are getting rather big and it would be good
  to make the full message list accessable and searchable. An SQL-aware table
  widget for this has been started in the cia-data-driven-tables branch.

- The XML parser (somewhat hacked up domish) breaks when messages specify
  a namespace.

- FIXME for hardcoding URLs in the ruleset browser
