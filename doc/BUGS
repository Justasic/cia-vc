Important
---------

- On an ircd that potentially sends back JOIN responses with different
  capitalization than the JOIN request, CIA will think it's been put in
  a channel it doesn't want to be in, and it will leave. Then it will
  rejoin. And that goes on... The channel lists in CIA are all supposed
  to be case insensitive, but apparently something's not.

- Bots need rate limiting and load balancing to prevent them from flooding off

- Some of the stats catalogs are getting rather big and it would be good
  to make the full message list accessable and searchable. An SQL-aware table
  widget for this has been started in the cia-data-driven-tables branch.

- Bots need to remove or disable their irc:// ruleset when kicked from a
  channel.

  This will become important once the web interface for IRC ruleset editing
  is written- if someone invites a CIA bot into a channel where it isn't
  wanted, the channel's ops need to be able to ask it to leave. As it is
  now, the botnet tries a little too hard and the bot will
  just immediately rejoin.

Not that important
------------------

- Leading spaces in commit messages aren't handled well. They aren't visible
  in the web interface because they aren't converted to non-breaking spaces
  where necessary, and due to strip()'ing the log in the IRC formatter,
  leading space is gone from the first line but there may be too much
  on the other lines. The stripping code should be changed to remove
  homogeneous leading spacing, and convert multiple spaces to &nbsp; in the
  XHTML formatters.

- The web server needs to be smarter about HTTP caching, mostly for static
  documents and for metadata value pages. (photos, for example) File-based
  documents could be stat'ed to determine the last modification. The
  stats_metadata table should probably acquire a modification time column,
  since that would also be useful for a thumbnail cache.

- The MIME types the web server gives out are a bit weird in the client
  scripts directory. Everything except HTML and images should probably be
  given out as text/plain.

- The XML parser (somewhat hacked up domish) breaks when messages specify
  a namespace.
