==================
Advanced Filtering
==================

Introduction
------------

There are two main steps in getting commit messages from the CIA
server to your own IRC channel:

 * Filtering

   The CIA server receives messages from thousands of
   projects, from over 10,000 authors. Which ones are you
   interested in?

 * Formatting

   Once a subset of CIA's messages have been selected, the
   bot still needs to present those in a useful format. CIA supports several
   message formats and several output media, but this document will
   focus on formatting commit messages for IRC.

CIA provides a simple facility for configuring its filtering and
formatting functionality: the *ruleset* language.

Basic Examples
--------------

Rulesets are specified in XML, but try not to let that turn you
off. What's important is that rulesets are both hierarchial and
sequential. Here is an example of a simple ruleset::

  <match path="project"> xchat-gnome </match>
  <formatter medium="irc"/>

This ruleset will discard all commit messages that didn't come
from the "xchat-gnome" project, then it will apply the default
IRC formatting to those messages.

How about a few more simple examples. This one will match
commits made to CIA itself, on the "cia" module of the "navi-misc"
project::

  <match path="project"> navi-misc </match>
  <match path="module"> cia </match>
  <formatter medium="irc"/>

This one will look for any commit with the word "cheese" in its
log message. Additionally, we'll run a specific formatter which
prepends the project name to every line of formatted text::

  <find path="log"> cheese </match>
  <formatter medium="irc"/>
  <formatter name="IRCProjectName"/>

General Form
------------

By now you might have noticed a few things about rulesets:

  * Filtering and formatting commands can be freely intermixed.

  * Multiple <match>'es act like a boolean AND. They must all
    match for the ruleset to give any output.

  * Formatters can be stacked. In the last example, the
    IRCProjectName formatter operated on the output of the
    generic IRC formatter.

Conceptually a ruleset is processed command by command,
in order, on every message delivered to CIA. Some messages
cause the ruleset to return formatted output, and some
messages cause it to return nothing.

Every command can operate on two pieces of execution state: the
current message and the current result. The message is read-only, of
course. The "current result" is what the ruleset would return if it
were to terminate immediately.

There are four types of commands:

  * Formatters modify the current result.

      Their input may include the current message, the current
      result, and various arguments supplied via the ruleset.

  * Filters examine the current message, returning either a True
    or False value.

      If they return False, the current rule stops
      executing. Multiple filters can be combined using the boolean
      containers <and>, <or>, and <not>.

  * Nested rules.

      A <rule> element, just like the ruleset as a whole,
      executes each of its child elements in order until a filter returns
      False. The behaviour of <rule> and <and> can be very similar,
      however only <rule> may include formatters and flow control commands.

  * Flow control.

      A ruleset or <rule> can contain a couple simple flow
      control elements. The <break> element will terminate the entire ruleset
      (even if it occurs within a nested <rule>) without modifying the
      current result. The <return> element is like <break>, however it always
      modifies the current result.


Filter Syntax
-------------

Filters are boolean expressions which take a single CIA message as their input.
The workhorses of any filter are the <find> and <match> elements.

Every CIA message can be represented by an XML document. The <find> and
<match> element each select a subset of this XML document using an
XPath query, then they perform a string comparison on the text in that
subset.

The CIA server only makes a very small subset of XPath available. Paths
must be absolute, and only the default (child::) axis is supported. This
means you can write paths like "/message/source/project", for example,
to locate the <project> element in a CIA message.

These XPaths get tedious pretty fast. CIA supports a shorthand for
common paths. Nearly all filtering tasks on commit messages can be
performed without ever using a real XPath:

============ ===========================================
Shortcut     Full path
============ ===========================================
author       /message/body/commit/author
branch       /message/source/branch
files        /message/body/commit/files
log          /message/body/commit/log
module       /message/source/module
project      /message/source/project
revision     /message/body/commit/revision
url          /message/body/commit/url
version      /message/body/commit/version
============ ===========================================

This is a complete list of filtering elements which may occur in a ruleset.
Note that filtering elements may only contain other filtering elements, never
formatting or flow control elements.

<**find** path="*XPath*" [caseSensitive="1"]> [*query*] </find>

  Perform an XPath query against the current message. For each query result:

    * All text within the matched element is recursively flattened into a single string.

    * The provided query string is searched for within that string.

  If the query string is found within any of the XPath results, this filter
  returns True. By default the string comparison is case insensitive.
  This can be changed by setting the "caseSensitive" attribute to one.

  Note that the query string can be omitted. This causes the <find>
  element to match the empty string against all XPath results. Since
  a search for the empty string always succeeds, the <find> element will
  return True if and only if the XPath returned any results.

<**match** path="*XPath*" [caseSensitive="1"]> *query* </match>

  Perform an XPath query against the current message. For each query result:

    * All text immediately within the matched element flattened into a
      single string. Text within children of the matched element is ignored.

    * The provided query string is matched against that string. Leading
      and trailing whitespace is ignored.

  If the query string is matched against any of the XPath results, this filter
  returns True. By default the string comparison is case insensitive.
  This can be changed by setting the "caseSensitive" attribute to one.

<**true**/>

  Always returns True.

<**false**/>

  Always returns False. Note that this element can be used as an alternative
  to <break/> when you wish to stop the current <rule> from executing, but
  not the entire ruleset.

<**and**> [*filters...*] </and>

  Boolean AND. Returns True unless any child filter evaluates to False.

<**or**> [*filters...*] </or>

  Boolean OR. Returns False unless any child filter evaluates to True.

<**not**> [*filters...*] </not>

  Boolean NOT. Typically this is used to negate a single child filter.
  If you use this with multiple child filters, the behaviour is actually
  a logical NOR. It returns False if and only if any child evaluates to True.


Filter Examples
---------------

This is an abbreviated version of the ruleset used by the #tacobeam channel
on Freenode. It uses several levels of nested boolean elements. Each section
is explained with inline comments. You may use XML-style comments in rulesets,
but there's no need to. All text within a container element is ignored::

  <or>

    Show Micah's commits, but filter out a few projects where
    there are other folks that also commit under the name "micah".

    <and>
      <match path="author"> micah </match>
      <not><match path="project"> kde </match></not>
      <not><match path="project"> debian-kernel </match></not>
    </and>

    These are more people that hang out in #tacobeam.
    Show all their commits.

    <match path="author"> chipx86 </match>
    <match path="author"> davidtrowbridge </match>
    <match path="author"> darkstar62 </match>
    <match path="author"> evan </match>
    <match path="author"> lurgyman </match>
    <match path="author"> fiberchunks </match>
    <match path="author"> file </match>
    <match path="author"> numist </match>
    <match path="author"> pagefault </match>
    <match path="author"> orph </match>
    <match path="author"> orphennui </match>

    We want to show Mike's commits, but he has an awfully common name,
    so we'll explititly list the projects he's involved in. This uses
    'find' rather than 'match' on Mike, since some projects include his
    email address in the author name.

    <and>
      <find path="author"> Mike </find>
      <or>
        <match path="project"> galago </match>       
        <match path="project"> autopackage </match>
      </or>
    </and>

    We like Kergoth, but we got tired of his commits to KergothWOWBits.
    Explicitly filter out that project when we accept commits from him.

    <and>
      <match path="author"> kergoth </match>
      <not><match path="project"> KergothWOWBits </match></not>
    </and>

    These are some projects hosted on our servers.
    Show all the commits to them.

    <match path="project"> navi-misc </match>
    <match path="project"> view </match>

  </or>
  <formatter medium="irc"/>
  <formatter name="IRCProjectName"/>


It's best to use the <match> element to pinpoint the part of a message
you need, but sometimes you want to perform a deeper search on a larger
part of a message. In this example, we'll search for commits to Interduck
that include the text "/local/htdocs" in their list of files. This type
of filter could be used to extract messages to just part of a larger
project, even when the project's owners aren't providing module
information::

  <match path="project"> interduck </match>
  <find path="files"> /local/htdocs </find>
  <formatter medium="irc"/>

Messages include more than just a project, author, and commit message.
For an example, you can use CIA's stats browser to view the unformatted
XML version of any message. One such bit of information is the name
of the client script that generated a message. The generator name is
just a freeform string, but it typically includes the name of the
revision control system the client is for.

If you were a developer on Subversion, for example, you may want to
see all messages that have "Subversion" or "SVN" in the name of their
client script::

  <or>
    <find path="/message/generator/name"> Subversion </find>
    <find path="/message/generator/name"> SVN </find>
  </or>
  <formatter medium="irc"/>
  <formatter name="IRCProjectName"/>


Formatter Syntax
----------------

All message formatting in a ruleset is performed using the <formatter> element.
It comes in two flavors:

<**formatter** name="*name*"> [*options*] </formatter>

  Invoke a particular formatter, by name.

<**formatter** medium="*medium*"> [*options*] </formatter>

  Search for a formatter that is compatible with the current message,
  and that will generate output for the given medium.

Because the CIA server is designed to work with many types of input messages
(commits, automated build results, bug tracking updates) and many output media
(IRC, XHTML, plain text) it has many formatters available. In the context of IRC,
however, only a few of these are useful:

 * **CommitToIRC**

   This formatter converts commit messages to IRC. This is generally the formatter
   that will be chosen when you use *<formatter medium="irc">*.

 * **IRCProjectName**

   This is a very simple formatter that prepends the current message's project
   name to each line of the last formatter's output. The project name is in bold.
   It is often useful to conditionally apply this formatter in a ruleset, using
   nested rules.

A ruleset operating on a commit message and rendering using *<formatter medium="irc">*
will invoke the *CommitToIRC* formatter. This formatter is quite customizable. The
following elements, inside a <formatter> element, will be processed by the *CommitToIRC*
formatter:

<**crunchWhitespace**/>

  Normally *CommitToIRC* will do its best to remove extra indentation and newlines
  from a message, while preserving its overall whitespace structure. Indented sections
  of the log will remain indented.

  If this option is present, the formatter will replace all groups of one or more
  whitespace characters with a single space. Newlines will be converted to individual
  spaces, and multiple spaces will be collapsed.

<**noColor**/>

  Disable the use of color in the default message formating. Note that this will
  not work when using the <format> parameter, since <format> overrides the default
  message formatting.

<**lineLimit**> *limit* </lineLimit>

  Set the maximum number of lines that will be output for an individual commit.
  Defaults to 6.

<**widthLimit**> *limit* </widthLimit>

  Any lines in the log message longer than this many characters will be wrapped.
  Defaults to 220.

<**wrapWidth**> *width* </wrapWidth>

  If a line is wrapped, it will be wrapped to this many characters.
  Defaults to 80.

<**filesWidthLimit**> *limit* </filesWidthLimit>

  If the commit's file list would be longer than this many characters, summarize it.
  Defaults to 60.  

<**format** [appliesTo="*formatter*"]> *message formatting* </format>

  Override the default message format completely. Because this element
  can not be used practically with multiple formatters, it is recommended
  to use the 'appliesTo' attribute in order to restrict it to a single
  formatter.

The <format> element is the most flexible way to control the output of
your ruleset. Its parameter is a simple markup language which lets you
individually place all the components that make up a commit message.
As an example, this would recreate the default format::

  <formatter medium="irc">
    <format appliesTo="CommitToIRC">
        <autoHide><color fg='green'><author/></color></autoHide>
        <autoHide><color fg='orange'><branch/></color></autoHide>
        *
        <autoHide><b><version/></b></autoHide>
        <autoHide>r<b><revision/></b></autoHide>
        <color fg='aqua'><module/></color>/<files/><b>:</b>
        <log/>
    </format>
  </formatter>

Simple customizations can be made by copying this formatter into your
ruleset and rearranging its elements or modifying its colors.

A detailed description of the <format> markup recognized by
the *CommitToIRC* formatter:

<**autoHide**> *format markup* </autoHide>

  If any formatter components within this element return
  no value, hide the entire contents of this element.

<**br**/>

  Insert a newline. Literal text within the format markup is allowed,
  but redundant whitespace is eliminated.

<**author**/>, <**version**/>, <**revision**/>, <**branch**/>, <**module**/>, and <**project**/>

  Insert the respective text from the commit message. These are shortcuts for
  the <text> element.

<**text** path="*XPath*"/>

  Insert text from the original commit message, searching using the provided
  XPath. You can use this to insert any arbitrary data that was present in
  the original commit message. See the section above on filter syntax for
  more information on message paths.

<**files**/>

  Insert the commit's list of files. The file list is split into a common prefix
  and a sensibly-sized list of individual files. If the list is too long, it will
  automatically be summarized.

<**log**/>

  Insert the commit's log message, with automatic word wrapping and various
  forms of automatic whitespace normalization and truncation.

<**b**> *format markup* </b>

  All text within this tag will be made bold, using IRC color codes.

<**u**> *format markup* </u>

  All text within this tag will be underlined, using IRC color codes.

<**color** [fg="*foreground*"] [bg="*background*"]> *format markup* </color>

  Apply a foreground and/or background color to the enclosed text. The actual
  appearance of these colors may vary with each IRC client. The foreground
  and background may each be one of the following:
     
     * aqua
     * black
     * blue
     * brown
     * dark blue
     * dark green
     * dark red
     * gray
     * green
     * grey
     * light blue
     * light gray
     * light green
     * light grey
     * light red
     * orange
     * purple
     * red
     * violet
     * white
     * yellow


Formatter Examples
------------------

This is the ruleset for #freebsd-src. It creates a completely custom
look for commits using the <format> element, plus it overrides several
default settings::
 
  <match path="project"> freebsd </match>

  <formatter medium="irc">

    <filesWidthLimit>40</filesWidthLimit>
    <lineLimit>1</lineLimit>
    <wrapWidth>150</wrapWidth>
    <widthLimit>150</widthLimit>
    <crunchWhitespace/>

    <format appliesTo="CommitToIRC">
      <b>[<module/>]</b>
      <autoHide><b>[<branch/>]</b></autoHide>
      <color fg="orange"><author/></color>
      <b>*</b>
      <color fg="green"><files/></color>:
      <log/>
    </format>
  
  </formatter>

This is the ruleset for #gaim-commits. They primarily display commits
from the "gaim" project, but they also display commits from the "gaim"
module of the "trinity" project. They wanted to prefix commits with
their project name only if the project isn't "gaim". This pattern
could be useful in many situations where a channel shows multiple
projects, but a single project is an assumed default::

  <or>
    <match path="project"> gaim </match>
      <and>
        <match path="project"> trinity </match>
        <match path="module"> gaim </match>
     </and>
  </or>

  <formatter medium="irc"/>

  <rule>
    <not><match path="project"> gaim </match></not>
    <formatter name="IRCProjectName"/>
  </rule>


Flow Control Syntax
-------------------

There are only two flow control elements, and they're both pretty simple.
These elements are rarely useful when writing rulesets for IRC bots, but
they are included in this guide for completeness.

<**break**/>

  Stop processing the ruleset, returning immediately. The ruleset
  as a whole will return whatever the current result was when the
  <break> was encountered.

<**return** path="*XPath*"/>

  Stop processing the ruleset, replacing the current result with
  the recursively flattened strings found within the first XPath
  match. If there are no XPath matches, the ruleset will return nothing.

<**return**> *return value* </return>

  Stop processing the ruleset, replacing the current result with
  a literal return value.
