Getting Started Developing CIA
==============================

Want to help with CIA? Below are a few common starting points. We encourage
you to join the IRC channel, #cia on Freenode_,  or `drop us a line`_.

Writing Client Scripts
----------------------

This is the easiest way to get involved with CIA. Do you want to add support
for a new revision control system? Do you want to improve one of the existing
client scripts?

The best way to get started is probably by using some of the existing
`existing scripts`_ as examples. There is also an `XML schema`_ for the
messages accepted by CIA.

.. _existing scripts: /doc/clients/
.. _XML schema: http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/cia/xml/schema.xsd

Getting the Source
------------------

The CIA source is available in a public `Subversion repository`_::

  svn co http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/cia

.. _Subversion repository: http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/cia/

Running Your Own Server
-----------------------

CIA is a complex system. It was designed to be a centrally-administered
service, so it is fairly difficult to install and maintain. This is a diagram
of CIA's major components:

If you're interested in running or developing on an isolated part of CIA,
it may not be necessary to run every service that a production server would
run. If you do want to run the entire application, setup can be daunting.

The Development and Small Deployment VM
---------------------------------------

To make this process a bit easier, you can now download a virtual machine
image which contains a full Ubuntu Linux server with nearly all of CIA
already installed and configured. This is a VMware_ virtual machine, so you'll
need either the free VMware Player, VMware Server, or another of their
products.

 * `Download the CIA DSD VM, 2007-04-07 release`_ (152 MB)

.. _VMware: http://vmware.com
.. _Download the CIA DSD VM, 2007-04-07 release: http://releases.navi.cx/cia/cia-dsd-vm-20070407.tar.bz2

After booting, you can use SSH or the local console to log in with the
username "cia" and password "changeme". A web server should automatically
start on port 80. The VM will try to obtain an IP address via DHCP by
default, so you'll need to log in and use "ifconfig" to see what IP it
ended up with. You should be able to immediately connect to the CIA web
interface, and either create a new user or log in with username "admin"
and password "changeme".

For secure deployment:

  1. Change the 'cia' account password
  2. Generate a new OpenSSH private key
  3. Generate a new Django secret (~/.django_secret)
  4. Generate a new CIA capability key (~/.cia_key)
  5. Generate a new HTTPS certificate for Pound
  6. Either deactivate the "admin" Django user or change its password

Other things to change:

  1. Set a publically-visible hostname in settings.py and bootstrap.sh, and in the django_site database table.
  2. Set up admin addresses in settings.py and /etc/aliases

Known problems:

  1. There is no init script for the Twisted daemons. They will be
     started automatically by an @reboot line in crontab, but you'll
     need to maintain them using the scripts in ~/cia/conf.
  2. Several URLs on the site will point to http://cia-dsd-vm/... until
     you change the hostname in bootstrap.sh. (Or whichever script you're
     using to start up the Twisted Web daemons)
  3. E-mail support is not yet configured. You'll need to set up procmail
     correctly, then set up /etc/aliases, .forward, and .procmailrc using
     the templates in ~/cia/conf.
