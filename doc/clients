CIA Clients
===========

This page is organized into sections based on the type of system you want to connect to CIA.
If you have written a new CIA client script, send it to Micah_ to get it added to this list.

Bazaar

BitKeeper
---------

Chris Larson has contributed a client for BitKeeper. You'll need both
ciabot_bk.sh_ and post-outgoing.ciabot_.

.. _ciabot_bk.sh: /clients/bk/ciabot_bk.sh
.. _post-outgoing.ciabot: /clients/bk/post-outgoing.ciabot

CVS
---

Petr Baudis has written the definitive CIA client for the Concurrent Versions System, ciabot_cvs.pl_.
It is written in Perl, sends its commits over e-mail or XML-RPC, and even supports a simple system
for client-side filtering of unwanted messages.

If you're using version 1.12 of CVS, you'll need to use a version of the client script that supports
its new loginfo format. ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl_ was contributed by Jeffrey Carlyle.

There is a `HOW-TO document`_ with a walk-through for using the CVS client script with `SourceForge.net`_.

.. _ciabot_cvs.pl: /clients/cvs/ciabot_cvs.pl
.. _ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl: /clients/cvs/ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl
.. _HOW-TO document: /doc/sourceforge-howto/
.. _SourceForge.net: http://sourceforge.net


Darcs
-----

Patrick McFarland has contrbuted a client for Darcs_, which acts as a
wrapper for your real 'darcs' binary. Download it `from Patrick's site`_
or grab the `local copy of cia_darcs.pl`_.

.. _Darcs: http://abridgegame.org/darcs/
.. _from Patrick's site: http://www.shadowconflict.com/darcs/darcs-cia/darcs
.. _local copy of cia_darcs.pl: /clients/darcs/cia_darcs.pl

Git
---

The `Git Wiki's page on Interfaces, Frontends, and Tools`_ has a section for CIA clients.
Petr Baudis wrote the ciabot.pl client script, available in Cogito's "contrib" directory.
Fernando J. Pereda wrote a shell-script alternative.
You can download a `local copy of ciabot.pl`_ or `ciabot.bash`_.

.. _Git Wiki's page on Interfaces, Frontends, and Tools: http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#ciabot
.. _local copy of ciabot.pl: /clients/git/ciabot.pl
.. _ciabot.bash: /clients/git/ciabot.bash

Subversion
----------

The CIA server now has built-in support for Subversion repositories. You don't need a client
script when using this built-in support. (However, the client script is more customizable and
a little faster.)

Micah Dowty has written two CIA clients for Subversion. The simpler of the two, ciabot_svn.sh_,
only supports email, and provides no way to include branch or module information. A more complex
script written in Python, ciabot_svn.py_, uses XML-RPC via Python's standard xmlrpclib module and
supports regular expressions for extracting module and branch information from paths.

André Malo's spiffy svnmailer_ package is a tool that can post commit
information to a variety of services, including mail, news, and CIA.

.. _ciabot_svn.py: /clients/svn/ciabot_svn.py
.. _ciabot_svn.sh: /clients/svn/ciabot_svn.sh

Trac
----

Interested in developing CIA support for Trac? There is an open `enhancement request for a notification plugin`_.
This ticket includes a patch with a very simple CIA client.
