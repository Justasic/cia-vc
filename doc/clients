This page is organized into sections based on the type of system you want to connect to CIA.
If you have written a new CIA client script, send it to Micah_ to get it added to this list.

ciabot_bk.sh_ and post-outgoing.ciabot_.

.. _post-outgoing.ciabot: /clients/bk/post-outgoing.ciabot

CVS
---

Petr Baudis has written the definitive CIA client for the Concurrent Versions System, ciabot_cvs.pl_.
It is written in Perl, sends its commits over e-mail or XML-RPC, and even supports a simple system
for client-side filtering of unwanted messages.

If you're using version 1.12 of CVS, you'll need to use a version of the client script that supports
its new loginfo format. ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl_ was contributed by Jeffrey Carlyle.

There is a `HOW-TO document`_ with a walk-through for using the CVS client script with `SourceForge.net`_.

.. _ciabot_cvs.pl: /clients/cvs/ciabot_cvs.pl
.. _ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl: /clients/cvs/ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl

Darcs
-----

Patrick McFarland has contrbuted a client for Darcs_, which acts as a
wrapper for your real 'darcs' binary. Download it `from Patrick's site`_
or grab the `local copy of cia_darcs.pl`_.

.. _Darcs: http://abridgegame.org/darcs/

Subversion
----------

The CIA server now has built-in support for Subversion repositories. You don't need a client
script when using this built-in support.

Micah Dowty has written two CIA clients for Subversion. The simpler of the two, ciabot_svn.sh_,
only supports email, and provides no way to include branch or module information. A more complex
script written in Python, ciabot_svn.py_, uses XML-RPC via Python's standard xmlrpclib module and
supports regular expressions for extracting module and branch information from paths.

Andr√© Malo's spiffy svnmailer_ package is a tool that can post commit
information to a variety of services, including mail, news, and CIA.
