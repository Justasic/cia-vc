CIA Clients
===========

This page is organized into sections based on the type of system you want to connect to CIA.
If you have written a new CIA client script, send it to Micah_ to get it added to this list.

BitKeeper
---------

Chris Larson has contributed a client for BitKeeper. You'll need both
ciabot_bk.sh_ and post-outgoing.ciabot_.

.. _ciabot_bk.sh: /clients/bk/ciabot_bk.sh
.. _post-outgoing.ciabot: /clients/bk/post-outgoing.ciabot

CVS
---

Petr Baudis has written the definitive CIA client for the Concurrent Versions System, ciabot_cvs.pl_.
It is written in Perl, sends its commits over e-mail or XML-RPC, and even supports a simple system
for client-side filtering of unwanted messages.

If you're using version 1.12 of CVS, you'll need to use a version of the client script that supports
its new loginfo format. ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl_ was contributed by Jeffrey Carlyle.

.. _ciabot_cvs.pl: /clients/cvs/ciabot_cvs.pl
.. _ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl: /clients/cvs/ciabot_cvs_1.12.pl

Subversion
----------

Micah Dowty has written two CIA clients for Subversion. The simpler of the two, ciabot_svn.sh_,
only supports email, and provides no way to include branch or module information. A more complex
script written in Python, ciabot_svn.py_, uses XML-RPC via Python's standard xmlrpclib module and
supports regular expressions for extracting module and branch information from paths.

Andre Malo's spiffy svnmailer_ package is a tool that can post commit
information to a variety of services, including mail, news, and CIA.
