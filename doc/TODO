To-do List
==========

Current priorities
------------------

- Usability improvements

  - Sparklines and interactive graphs, produced with fidtool. Prerequisites:

    - We need a place to store the fidtool files. This probably means cleaning
      up the filesystem-based Stats storage a little.

    - Fidtool itself is fairly complete, but needs much testing.

    - Implement a frontend for fidtool. At first this can be in the form of
      static sparklines and interval queries, however a draggable AJAX graph
      would be nice.

    - Use interval queries to build indexes of 'most active' and 'most recent'
      items. We can probably use the database to keep an upper bound on activity
      which is incremented on every commit. These upper bounds, after sorting, would
      be lowered by performing fidtool interval queries.


New Web Interface
-----------------

There is a new web interface under development, using Django. It will eventually
replace the old web interface entirely, but it's currently only used for managing
user accounts and assets (such as bots, projects, and authors).

- Abuse prevention

  - The ability to revert changes from the change history page

  - Enforce network uniqueness. Currently, users may create multiple IRC "networks"
    which actually refer to the same physical network. This can happen by accident,
    or it might be abused maliciously to cause multiple CIA bots to join a single
    channel or to introduce bots into channels where they aren't wanted.

    This is a difficult problem to solve. Two servers may refer to the same network
    because they are multiple DNS names for the same IP, multiple IPs on the same
    server, or multiple servers linked together on a single IRC network.

    Various methods could be used to determine server uniqueness at network creation
    time:

      - Use the NETWORK= portion of the 005 (server capabilities) message. This is
        simple and straight-forward, and it's supported by most networks I've tested.
        The biggest exception is Freenode.

        Networks that don't send a NETWORK= field will still work with CIA, they'll
	just have to be installed by an administrator first. The "add bot" page will
	conduct a network identification test when the user submits the page with
        a network of "Other...".

        Note that this means we'll no longer ask the user for a network description.
        Either it comes from the NETWORK= field, or we need to involve an admin.

        Some test code for this method is in tools/irc-tester.py

      - Create a 'fuzzy' hash of the network's identity by examining the names and
        topics of the most popular IRC channels on a server. This wouldn't be guaranteed
        against false positives, but false negatives (which can be abused) would never
        occur. This approach has the advantage of requiring no extra IRC connections
        aside from a single connect while adding new networks.

      - Look for other CIA bots, and verify the identity of those bots. This would be
        very reliable, but it requires changes to the bot daemon and it requires
        that we maintain at least one bot on all networks in order to perform these
        checks.

     Verifying networks at creation-time solves most problems, but it isn't quite
     a complete solution. Servers may at some later time switch networks. The result is
     that we may have to merge our own concept of a "network". This will be harder
     to solve, and will definitely require support from the bot daemon.

  - Require the consent of IRC channel operators in order to install new IRC bots.
    In theory this is a fairly simple thing to do- but it requires changes in the bot
    daemon, which makes it fairly difficult at the moment. See below.

- Ruleset editor improvements

  - Automatically size the ruleset editor textarea to fit the screen?

  - Ruleset indentation (automatic, and manual- support for the Tab key)

  - Ruleset error/syntax hilighting using CodePress (which apparently does indeed work on Safari)

- Image uploader improvements

  - Support more image formats: In particular, the current uploader doesn't handle interlaced PNG

  - Optimize the resulting PNG files. Look into using optipng or pngcrush

  - Ditch PIL's buggy thumbnailing code (and all my workarounds)

Deep Changes
------------

- Separate the HTTP frontend from the message delivery engine. The message delivery
  engine itself should be a separate daemon, preferably something that can be scaled
  well. This means more efficient algorithms for ruleset matching, and seamless
  interaction between multiple message delivery hosts. This daemon has been codenamed
  Esquilax_.

- The IRC bot server is another scalability and reliability bottleneck. I'd like the
  entire bot server to be a "disposable" daemon, which keeps all its connection state
  and the sockets itself in a separate simple process. The codename for this socket
  broker daemon is Caterpillar_.

The wiki pages linked above are really just my own notes on the subject- they are
a little disorganized, and subject to change. If you'd like to contribute to any of
these projects or you're curious how they work, please contact Micah_ directly.

Messages
--------

- Clean up the versioning in messages so the semantics are clear. Arch
  revisions like rhythmbox-devel@gnome.org--2004/rhythmbox--main--0.7--patch-17
  and subversion revisions like r3962 could be represented using <version style="arch">
  and <version style="svn"> tags, respectively. CVS could include a tag like
  <version style="cvs">1.1.23</version> inside each <file>. BitKeeper would probably
  use something similar to svn's revisions.

- Make it possible for modular formatters to treat the files prefix and the rest
  of the file summary differently

- Add message delivery information to the XML-RPC hub.deliver() frontend. It should
  add a header in <generator> indicating the IP, hostname, and/or user agent of the sender.
  This can be used by rulesets like stats://host.

Documentation
-------------

- Add some more info on the XML-RPC interface. There's a little `API Documentation`_
  but it's incomplete.

- Document the XML message format, for client script maintainers.

.. _API Documentation: /doc/api/index


Old Web Interface
-----------------

- Make CIA more accessable to text browsers and non-CSS browsers.

- Some of the stats catalogs are getting rather big and it would be good
  to make the full message list accessable and searchable. An SQL-aware table
  widget for this has been started in the cia-data-driven-tables branch.

  - While implementing the searchability for these new tables, it would be possible
    for example to make URLs that query for commits between two dates. That would be
    a handy thing to have for ChipX86's status reports :)

- Clean up the relation graphing interface so it isn't stuck hackishly at /graph.
  Maybe stats metadata could be used to attach graphs to individual targets?

- Link from authors and projects in the stats browser's message lists to the appropriate
  author and project pages. It would be great to, while browsing a project, be able
  to easily see what a particular person is working on elsewhere. A few things to consider:

    - stats metadata could be used to make the connection without hardcoding
      any assumptions about the stats hierarchy into CIA, but where do these go?

    - How do we account for any differences in commit authors with stats author
      pages, as caused by the ruleset?

  One potential solution is, for each potentially linkable part of the commit message,
  the formatter (or some preprocessor that the runs before the formatter) looks for a
  stats:// ruleset using that part of the message in a path= attribute. If it finds one,
  it hyperlinks to the stats target that results from running the message through that
  ruleset. If there are multiple messages with matching path= attributes, it would have
  some way to determine which one is best.

IRC
---

- Bots will rejoin when kicked from a channel, they need to remove or disable their
  irc:// ruleset.

  This will become important once the web interface for IRC ruleset editing
  is written- if someone invites a CIA bot into a channel where it isn't
  wanted, the channel's ops need to be able to ask it to leave. As it is
  now, the botnet tries a little too hard and the bot will
  just immediately rejoin.

- Track bandwidth averages per-request and per-bot. This could be used to load balance
  the bots by rearranging requests among them, and it would make a nice indicator
  for the IRC status page
