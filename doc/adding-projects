Adding Projects
===============

There are only a few steps in connecting a project with CIA:

- Make sure you understand `how CIA works`_

- Download the `client script`_ that's right for you, following the
  instructions within to install it.

- Tada. The next time you commit, your project should show up in the
  #commits IRC channel on Freenode_, and in the `stats browser`_.

- If you want CIA to join a new IRC channel, contact Micah_ ('scanline'
  on Freenode_) and he will add a ruleset_ manually. The web interface
  for rulesets_ currently is read-only.

- Likewise, your project's stats page will be a bit dull. Projects
  or authors can add metadata to their stats page, to change the
  displayed title, add a URL to the project's homepage, add a short
  description, or even an image.

  The web interface for this isn't done however, so currently you
  have to bug Micah_ about it or ask for a 'metadata key' and try
  the command line tools.

  Some examples of stats pages that use metadata:

    - BZFlag_

    - Gaim_

    - `Micah Dowty`_

    - `David Trowbridge`_
