Adding Projects
===============

There are only a few steps in connecting a project with CIA:

- Make sure you understand `how CIA works`_

- Download the `client script`_ that's right for you, following the
  instructions within to install it. If you're using Sourceforge, we
  have a detailed `HOWTO document`_ for setting up CIA.

- Tada. The next time you commit, your project should show up in the
  #commits IRC channel on Freenode_, and in the `stats browser`_.

- If you want CIA to join a new IRC channel or if you want to customize
  the appearance of your project on the web, `create an account`_.
