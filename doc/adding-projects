Adding Projects
===============

To add your project, you'll need either:

  - Any public Subversion repository

      (For instant notification, you also need a way to send
      a *ping* e-mail to CIA any time a change is committed.
      You can use an existing commits mailing list, or a very
      simple post-commit hook.)

  - A hosting provider like `SourceForge.net`_ or `Gna!`_ which
    includes built-in CIA support

  - A `CIA client script`_ for your project's revision control system

You'll also need a CIA account. `Register an account`_ if you
don't already have one, then `add your project`_.

.. _SourceForge.net: http://sourceforge.net
.. _Gna!: http://gna.org
.. _CIA client script: /doc/clients/
.. _Register an account: /account/register/
.. _add your project: /account/projects/add/
