Adding Projects
===============

There are only a few steps in connecting a project with CIA:

- Make sure you understand `how CIA works`_

- Download the `client script`_ that's right for you, following the
  instructions within to install it. If you're using Sourceforge, we
  have a detailed `HOWTO document`_ for setting up CIA.

.. _HOWTO document: /doc/sourceforge-howto

- Tada. The next time you commit, your project should show up in the
  #commits IRC channel on Freenode_, and in the `stats browser`_.

- If you want CIA to join a new IRC channel, contact Micah_ via email
  and he will add a ruleset_ manually. The web interface
  for rulesets_ currently is read-only.

- Likewise, your project's stats page will be a bit dull. Projects
  or authors can add metadata_ to their stats page, to change the
  displayed title, add a URL to the project's homepage, add a short
  description, or even an image.

  Some examples of stats pages that use metadata:

    - BZFlag_

    - Gaim_

    - `Micah Dowty`_

    - `David Trowbridge`_
