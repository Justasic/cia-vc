Frequently Asked Questions
==========================


* Will you edit the commit I just made?

    Generally, no. CIA's main job is to provide the latest news on many projects,
    not to provide accurate revision history. In the future there may be tools to
    let project admins change stored messages, but for now it's a very annoying
    process to change or delete a commit.


* I work on multiple projects, with different usernames on each. Can I still have a single author page?

    Yes. A rule for the `stats://author`_ ruleset can be added for you. Talk to
    someone with permission to edit it, like Micah_. There is, however, no good way to transfer
    stats from one author name to another yet.

.. _`stats://author`: /rulesets/stats/author
.. _Micah: mailto:micah@navi.cx


* Does CIA work with Sourceforge_?

    Yes. Many projects on CIA are `hosted by sourceforge`_. We have a `HOWTO document`_ for setting up
    SourceForge's CVS repositories with CIA, and their Subversion repositories include built-in CIA
    support.

.. _Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net
.. _hosted by sourceforge: /stats/host/sourceforge
.. _HOWTO document: /doc/sourceforge-howto

* Does CIA work with Savannah_?

    Probably not. Last we heard, they don't allow users to run scripts from CVS's loginfo file.

.. _Savannah: http://savannah.gnu.org

* Can I put messages from CIA on my web site?

    Yes. CIA exports RSS feeds for every stats target, so you can use any existing RSS aggregation
    software that can generate HTML.
