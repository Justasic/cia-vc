Frequently Asked Questions
==========================


* Will you edit the commit I just made?

    Generally, no. CIA's main job is to provide the latest news on many projects,
    not to provide accurate revision history. In the future there may be tools to
    let project admins change stored messages, but for now it's a very annoying
    process to change or delete a commit.


* I work on multiple projects, with different usernames on each. Can I still have a single author page?

    Yes. A rule for the `stats://author`_ ruleset can be added for you. Talk to
    someone with permission to edit it, like Micah_. There is, however, no good way to transfer
    stats from one author name to another yet.

.. _`stats://author`: /rulesets/stats/author
.. _Micah: mailto:micah@navi.cx


* Does CIA work with Sourceforge_?

    Yes. Many projects on CIA are `hosted by sourceforge`_. We even have a `HOWTO document`_ specifically focused on Sourceforge.

.. _Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net
.. _hosted by sourceforge: /stats/host/sourceforge
.. _HOWTO document: /doc/sourceforge-howto

* Does CIA work with Savannah_?

    Probably not. Last we heard, they don't allow users to run scripts from CVS's loginfo file.

.. _Savannah: http://savannah.gnu.org

* Can I put messages from CIA on my web site?

    Yes. CIA exports RSS feeds for every stats target, so you can use any existing RSS aggregation
    software that can generate HTML.

* Why doesn't CIA use XSLT to format its messages?

    This possibility was examined, however XSLT is badly suited to several of the formatting
    operations common to CIA, such as reducing lists of file names or wrapping text. For XSLT
    to be practical for formatting CIA messages, several extension functions would have to
    be added. While XSLT isn't quite powerful enough to format CIA messages easily, it is
    powerful enough it could be abused for denial of service attacks. As a consequence, it was
    decided that it would be better to write formatters primarily in Python but provide a way
    to control them using XML.

* Will you fix my broken HTML?

    No.
