CIA financial report
====================

The main CIA server is a hungry beast, and needs plenty of
bandwidth, disk space, and CPU power to keep going. This page
is an up-to-date record of our finances, in US dollars.

Note that the amount shown below is a little less than the
actual donation amount due to Paypal transaction fees. On
large donations though, they seem to have refunded the
transaction fee. In these cases, the full donation amount
is shown.

Much thanks go out to everyone who has donated! I've linked
contributors below to their CIA author pages. If a link is
wrong or you'd rather it point elsewhere, don't hesitate
to `email me`_.
