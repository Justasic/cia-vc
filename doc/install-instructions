Install Instructions
====================

1. Install the following libraries:
 - Python 2.*
 - twisted latest (11 as of this document)
 - Nginx (1.5.3 as of this document)
 - GCC, C++, ubuntu-buildessentials or similar package
 - MySQL
 - Git
 - pkg-config
2. ``git clone https://github.com/Justasic/cia-vc/ ~/cia``
3. ``cd ~/cia/django; sudo python setup.py install``
4. ``cd ~/cia/Nouvelle; sudo python setup.py install``
5. ``cd ~/cia/; make``
6. Edit any settings needed in ~/cia/settings.py (database settings are located in a file called ~/.cia_db, edit them there)
7. ``cd ~/cia/; ./manage syncdb``
8. merge ~/cia/init-7.noInnoDB.sql into the existing CIA database
9. Generate a new django secret and place it in ~/.django_secret
10. Install crontabs from ~/cia/conf/crontab
11. (optional) setup a mailserver based on documents from ~/cia/mail
12. ``cd ~/cia/; conf/bootstrap.sh``

CIA will now be running properly but nginx or pound/lighttpd must be setup to use any web services.

NOTE: This CIA installaton is in a non-root user's home directory. This is not necessary but recommended as CIA has run
in home directories and hard-coded paths may cause problems.

If you change a file in ~/cia/media-src, re-run ``make media`` in the root directory to apply the change.
