CIA open source notification system
-----------------------------------

CIA is at its heart a system for distributing commit messages from the
version control systems used by open source projects worldwide. It started
out as a simple IRC bot distributing commit messages from the PicoGUI project,
but has grown into a general message passing, filtering, and formatting system
with web, IRC, XML-RPC, and email interfaces.


-------- The most important top-level components of CIA:

  - cia_server.tac

    CIA's services for processing XML-RPC and web browser requests as well as
    its outgoing connections for IRC are all run from within one Twisted
    twistd process. This is the configuration file that plugs together the
    above module into an actual application.
    The CIA server is usually started by running "twistd -oy cia_server.tac"

  - incoming_mail.py

    A tiny script that can be placed in a procmailrc or .forward file to send
    email to the CIA server via its XML-RPC interface

  - ruleset_editor.py

    A PyGTK/Glade editor for CIA's rulesets

  - htdocs

    Contains the static files served by CIA's web interface. cia_server.tac
    injects several dynamic resources into the same namespace.


-------- An overview of CIA's internals:

  - LibCIA.Message

    Defines a generic format for passing messages around in XML, a python
    encapsulation for that format, a Hub to distribute these messages, and
    a Filter system based on XPath for selecting interesting messages

  - LibCIA.Formatters

    Accessed via the Message module, formatters provide a way to automatically
    convert messages to human-readable representations in different output media

  - LibCIA.Ruleset

    A ruleset associates a URI with a set of message filters and formatters,
    combining both into an intuitive but powerful XML format

  - LibCIA.IncomingMail

    Converts email messages to XML Messages, with support for the old CIA's
    format for backward compatibility.

  - LibCIA.IRC

    A URI handler used in conjunction with Rulesets to deliver messages to IRC
    channels. Defines a BotNetwork object that manages any number of bots on
    any number of IRC networks.

  - LibCIA.Stats

    Handles the stats:// URI used to collect information on messages. These stats
    can then be queried over the web or over XML-RPC.


-------- Requirements

 - Python 2.2.1 or later

 - Twisted

 - pygtk 2.0 or later for the GUI tools
