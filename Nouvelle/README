Nouvelle web framework
----------------------
Version 1.0

Nouvelle is a very simple web framework, similar to the 'nevow'
package in Quotient. Nouvelle has many similarities to nevow,
but several key differences.

At its heart, Nouvelle is just an engine for representing XML
data in an easy-to-use pure python syntax, and serializing this
data quickly. The CIA project (http://cia.navi.cx) uses Nouvelle
to render all of its web pages and RSS feeds.

Examples are included in this directory, see the doc string in
Nouvelle/__init__.py for more information about the theory of
operation.

- Installation:

  python ./setup.py install
