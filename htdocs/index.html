                        CIA is a system for tracking open-source projects in real-time. The most popular incarnation
                        of CIA now is a system of IRC bots that hang out mostly in #commits on <a href="http://freenode.org">Freenode</a>
                        and report commit messages from over 100 open source projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CIA has just been through a complete rewrite that makes its internals much cleaner, and lets
                        it track more than just commit messages with more than just IRC bots. The public interface
                        for stats and setup however isn't done yet. If you have a project you would like CIA to monitor,
                        talk to 'scanline' in #commits on freenode.

                        CIA is Free Software, licensed under the LGPL. The source is available from a
			<a href="http://navi.cx/svn/misc/trunk/cia/">Subversion repository</a>.

                        CIA started out as a simple bot hacked together by Micah Dowty in an afternoon to monitor commit
                        messages for the <a href="http://picogui.org">PicoGUI</a> project.
			Lalo Martins came up with the name "CIA" to refer to this IRC bot: PicoGUI is hosted in Subversion,
			and the bot was a brainless entity designed to keep an eye on subversion :)
	            </p></li>
                    <li>June 1, 2003<p>
		        About a week later, Mike Hearn suggested expanding it to work with other projects, displaying them
			all in one channel in addition to the project's home channel. After a morning of quick hacking,
			#commits on <a href="http://freenode.org">Freenode</a> was born. Popularity grew almost instantly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
		        Micah stepped into the shadows for a while. Mike maintained CIA, but the code remained stagnant.
			It was a quick hack, so incremental changes just made it messier. It needed a rewrite.
		    </p></li>
		    <li>December 13, 2003<p>
		        Micah finally gets the motivation to rewrite CIA, bringing you what you see here. About two weeks
			later it's nearing feature-completion.
