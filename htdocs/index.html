                        CIA is a system for tracking open-source projects in real-time. The most popular incarnation
                        of CIA now is a system of IRC bots that hang out mostly in #commits on <a href="http://freenode.org">freenode</a>
                        and report commit messages from over 100 open source projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CIA has just been through a complete rewrite that makes its internals much cleaner, and lets
                        it track more than just commit messages with more than just IRC bots. The public interface
                        for stats and setup however isn't done yet. If you have a project you would like CIA to monitor,
                        talk to 'scanline' in #commits on freenode.
                    </p>

                        Much more will be here once the web interface is finished...

                    <p>
                        CIA's new codebase is being developed in a <a href="http://navi.cx/svn/misc/trunk/cia/">Subversion repository</a>.
			Questions can be directed at its author, Micah Dowty, as 'scanline' on IRC or email to micah at picogui.org
