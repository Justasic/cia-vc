# CIA bot client script for Subversion repositories, delivering via email
# -- Micah Dowty <micah@navi.cx>
#
# See http://cia.navi.cx
# for more information on what the CIA bot is and how it works.
#
# To use the CIA bot in your Subversion repository...
#
# 1. Customize the parameters below, specifically the ones under
#    the "Project information" section
#
# 2. This script should be called from your repository's post-commit
#    hook with the repository and revision as arguments. For example,
#    you could copy this script into your repository's "hooks" directory
#    and add something like the following to the "post-commit" script,
#    also in the repository's "hooks" directory:
#
#      REPOS="$1"
#      REV="$2"
#      $REPOS/hooks/ciabot_svn.sh "$REPOS" "$REV"&
#
############# There are some parameters for this script that you can customize:

# Project information
#
# NOTE: This shouldn't be a long description of your project. Ideally
#       it is a short identifier with no spaces, punctuation, or
#       unnecessary capitalization. This will be used in URLs related
#       to your project, as an internal identifier, and in IRC messages.
#       If you want a longer name shown for your project on the web
#       interface, please use the "title" metadata key rather than
#       putting that here.
#
project_name="YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_HERE"
return_address="YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS@HERE"

# System
sendmail_command="/usr/sbin/sendmail -t"

############# Below this line you shouldn't have to change anything

# Script arguments
REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"

# The email address CIA lives at
cia_address="cia@cia.navi.cx"

author=`svnlook author -r "$REV" "$REPOS" | sed 's/\&/\&amp;/g;s/</\&lt;/g;s/>/\&gt;/g'`
log=`svnlook log -r "$REV" "$REPOS" | sed 's/\&/\&amp;/g;s/</\&lt;/g;s/>/\&gt;/g'`
diff_lines=`svnlook diff -r "$REV" "$REPOS" | wc -l`
for file in `svnlook changed -r "$REV" "$REPOS" | cut -c 3- | sed 's/\&/\&amp;/g;s/</\&lt;/g;s/>/\&gt;/g'`; do
    files="$files<file>$file</file>"
done
